     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <h3>Purpose</h3>
     <p>I propose to create an alternative website to social media. A simple blog. What makes it different? I am not barraged by endless feeds and propaganda. Itâ€™s just me, and those I wish to be there. I can share photos and posts with others, and others can get in contact with me if they so desire. A simple blog the perfect middle between cutting social media, and still being connected with the world.</p>  <!-- change this -->


     <h3>Audience</h3>
     <p>Anyone I decide to invite to see the blog, usually family and friends, and perhaps collegues.</p>  <!-- change this -->
