<p>This is the famous St.Basils Cathedral in Moscows Red Square. Some Americans have joked to me and said that it is the ice cream church, for the resembelance of ice cream cones on the top. To the left is the Kremlin. And to the right is GUM, a very popular mall. </p>

<p>One of my favorite travel opportunities. I traveled all the way to "the end of Russia" also known as Vladivostok. Here you are closer to the Californian coast than Moscow! On the far eastern side of Russia there are many resembelances to Asia. This is perhaps due to it's history of being a Chinese and Japenese owned province. During summers you can find many people at the beach enjoying the sun and water.</p>
