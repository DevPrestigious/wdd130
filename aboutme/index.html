      <h2>Alexander Dohms</h2>
      <p> Fun Fact: I was born in Moscow, Russia. I have lived in America for more than 15 years. I can say that some sterotypes are true. Russians are cold on the outside but if you get them opened up, they're some of the best people I know. We also drink a lot. (just not me) Currently I am living in Moscow Russia again.</p>
      <p>I am in my last semester of Software Engineering as a Major and Finance as a Minor. I want to work for a small development team with my degree. Which company? I'm not sure yet. But currently I am working for Яндекс pronounced "Yandex" or "Russian Google." website here: <a href="http://www.yandex.ru">Yandex</a></p>
      <p> I have been a member of the Church since I was 12 years old. The best thing about the Church is how it is helped me to love others and myself. I also love how the Church is consistent in many other countries.
